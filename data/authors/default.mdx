I'm very ambitious front-end developer looking for a role in
established IT company with the opportunity to work with the latest
technologies on challenging and diverse projects.

I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
improving my chops one design problem at a time.

If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a family
person, father of a beautiful daughter, a sports fanatic,
photography enthusiast, and tech-obsessed!!!
